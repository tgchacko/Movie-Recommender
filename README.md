### Project Overview

This project involves creating a movie recommender system using various recommendation algorithms. The system includes simple recommenders, content-based filtering, and collaborative filtering techniques to provide movie recommendations.

### Data Sources

The project utilizes two datasets:
1.	**[Ratings Dataset (ratings_small.csv)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset)**: Contains user ratings for collaborative filtering.
- Entries: 100,004
- Columns: userId, movieId, rating
2.	**Movie Metadata and Credits Datasets**: Contains movie metadata and credits for content-based and simple recommenders.
- [tmdb_5000_movies.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata)
- [tmdb_5000_credits.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata)

### EDA Steps

- Data loading and initial exploration
- Data cleaning and manipulation
- Checking for missing values and duplicates
- Merging the movies and credits datasets

### Data Preprocessing Steps and Inspiration

- **Handling Missing Values**: Identified and handled missing values in the dataset.
- **Merging Datasets**: Merged the movies and credits datasets on the id column.
- **Feature Extraction**: Extracted relevant features such as cast, crew, genres, and overview for content-based filtering.
- **Creating Weighted Ratings**: Calculated weighted ratings for movies using the IMDB formula.

### Recommendation Techniques

- **Simple Recommender - IMDB Weighted Rating**: Uses a formula to calculate weighted ratings based on average rating, number of votes, and a minimum vote threshold.

- **Simple Recommender - Trending Movies**: Recommends trending movies based on popularity.

- **Content-Based Filtering**:
1) **Overview Based**: Recommends movies based on plot similarity using TF-IDF and cosine similarity. TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) is a statistical measure used to evaluate the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection of documents.
2) **Credits, Genres, and Keywords Based**: Recommends movies based on similarity in cast, crew, genres, and keywords using CountVectorizer and cosine similarity. Count Vectorize converts a collection of text documents to a matrix of token counts, helping in text analysis and feature extraction.

- **Collaborative Filtering**: Singular Value Decomposition (SVD): Uses matrix factorization to predict user ratings for movies based on past user ratings.

### Assumptions

- Ratings provided by users are reliable.
- User preferences are consistent over time.
- Movies with higher ratings are preferred by users.

### Evaluation Metrics for SVD

- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: Measures the average magnitude of errors in a set of predictions, without considering their direction.
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**: Measures the square root of the average squared differences between predicted and observed values.

### Results

### Recommendations

- Further data collection and feature engineering could improve the recommendation accuracy.
- Regularly updating the model with new movie data can help maintain recommendation relevance.
- Implementing user feedback mechanisms to continuously improve recommendations.

### Limitations

- The dataset may contain biases that could affect the recommendations.
- The recommendation performance is limited by the quality and quantity of the available data.


### Future Possibilities of the Project

- Exploring additional recommendation algorithms and ensemble methods.
- Implementing deep learning models for better performance.
- Developing real-time recommendation systems based on user interactions.
